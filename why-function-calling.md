# Q) Ever wondered why one of the most popular tools — The Calculator — is essential for Large Language Models (LLMs)? 

While LLMs excel at natural language understanding, coding, and reasoning, they struggle with precise mathematical computations.

### 1. The Math Problem with GPT3 - 175B model:

Research from the paper [Language Models are Few-Shot Learners" (Brown et al., 2020)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14165) highlights the accuracy drop in arithmetic tasks with GPT3 - 175B model:
- 2-digit addition/subtraction: 100% accuracy
- 3-digit addition/subtraction: 80% accuracy
- 4-digit arithmetic: 25% accuracy
- 5-digit arithmetic: 9% accuracy

### 2. The Math Problem with GPT4 model:
